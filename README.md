# WipEout 64 HD Texture Pack
An Unofficial F5000 Anti-Gravity Racing League High-Resolution Textures Project for WipEout 64.  
For use with Project64 / Mupen64Plus and GlideN64.

## Description :
A high-resolution texture pack which enhances the User-Interface of WipEout 64.

## How to install
- Download the repository as .zip then extract it to _/(emulator directory)/(default Plugins directory)_**/hires_texture/Wipeout 64**
- Enable **Use texture pack** in *Options > Configure Graphics Plugin > Texture enhancement > Texture Pack*.

**Note** : At the present time, no emulator / plug-in can correctly display the textures of WipEout 64. The textures had to be edited to work around this problem.  
- The normal HD textures can be found in the master branch, in case this issue is resolved in the future.  
It is not usable yet.
- In the "workaround" branch are stored the modified textures which can be rendered correctly (hack).  
Tested on **Project64 2.4.0** / **GlideN64 4.0 Public Release** (does not work on the latest version of GlideN64).
