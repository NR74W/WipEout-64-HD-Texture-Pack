# WipEout 64 HD Texture Pack
An Unofficial F5000 Anti-Gravity Racing League High-Resolution Textures Project for WipEout 64.  
For use with Project64 / Mupen64Plus and GlideN64.

## Description :
A high-resolution texture pack which enhances the User-Interface of WipEout 64.

## How to install
- Download the repository as .zip then extract it to _/(emulator directory)/(default Plugins directory)_**/hires_texture/Wipeout 64**
- Enable **Use texture pack** in *Options > Configure Graphics Plugin > Texture enhancement > Texture Pack*.

It is recommended to use a multiple of N64 resolution for the internal resolution setting, to prevent 2D elements from being rendered incorrectly (especially if MSAA is enabled).

Works correctly on **Project64 3.0** / **GlideN64** latest development build _(as of June 2021)_.
